# Pʟᴏᴛʟʏ++

Plotly++ is a header-only C++ graphing library for creating interactive plots and charts, with rendering powered by [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript). Plots are generated as HTML files, providing interactive visualizations that can be viewed in a web browser.

This makes Plotly++ extremely lightweight for C++ applications; no graphics or rendering libraries or frameworks are required! Plotly++'s only additional dependency is a JSON library.

The more than 40 chart types supported by Plotly.js are supported by Plotly++.

Plotly++ is largely auto-generated from offical Plotly.js sources.
